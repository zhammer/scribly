# scribly (glitch edition!)

write stories together (on glitch!)

### glitch

i've ported this project (which lives at scribly.herokuapp.com at the moment) to glitch. if you're curious in seeing what the heroku vs. glitch version looks like, you can check out https://github.com/zhammer/scribly/compare/glitch.

this is a fairly complex app with users, a database and emails. remix it and play around!

### tech goals

- traditional web app
- accessible/a11y-friendly website
- js not required for basic functionality
- expressive architecture/code
- tests that ensure core functionality, aren't too invasive, and improve understandibility of app
